/**
 * {@code EpsPageOperators} is a utility class for methods related to EPS page
 * scaling and positioning, starting and ending a page, and writing a content
 * line to the page. It works directly with a {@link StringBuilder} instead of
 * the primary {@code EpsWriter}, as the start and end of the EPS Document often
 * are written using a different {@link StringBuilder} than the one that the
 * {@code EpsWriter} uses to write the main EPS content, due to the order of
 * content handling (the main EPS content is generally gathered ahead of time).
 * <p>
 * Numbers that are written directly to PostScript must be single-precision
 * floating-point, to be compatible with the largest number of EPS clients, as
 * the EPS format generally requires single-precision precision and integers.
 *
 * @version 1.0
