/**
 * {@code EpsDocument} is a class that represents an EPS Document. Its methods
 * adhere to Adobe's Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) File Format Specification:
 * <p>
 * https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/actionscript/articles/5002.EPSF_Spec.pdf
 * <p>
 * EPS is a specialized form of PostScript that complies with the Document
 * Structuring Conventions (DSC) and is intended to be embedded inside another
 * PostScript file. An EPS file must contain a special first line that
 * identifies that it as an EPS file (e.g. %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0), and it must
 * contain a %%BoundingBox: line. The EPS file only draws within the rectangle
 * defined by the Bounding Box. The PostScript code must avoid using PostScript
 * operators that would interfere with the embedding. These include operators
 * with global effects such as changing the Page Size, and changing the half
 * tone screen. Note that DSC continues to evolve to support PDF, and that only
 * the oldest tags can be assumed to be supported by EPS clients and readers.
 * <p>
 * All numeric values that are to be written as strings to PostScript, must be
 * specified as single-precision. Only numbers that interact directly with AWT
 * Transforms should be double-precision.
 * <p>
 * The {@link EpsDocument} class is the primary way for clients to interact with
 * this library, and is also where one fetches an instance of the specialized
 * {@link EpsGraphics2D} Graphics Context for redirecting normal screen output
 * to an Encapsulated PostScript file.
 * <p>
 * As Encapsulated PostScript files are always limited to just one page, there
 * is no need to separate functionality between this class and what would have
 * been a rather sparse and redundant EpsPage class. The Page is the Document.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create a new EPS Document.
 * EpsDocument epsDocument = new EpsDocument();
 *
 * // Get the Graphics Context for drawing the EPS content.
 * Graphics2D epsGraphics = epsDocument.getGraphics2D();
 *
 * // Line thickness of 1.5.
 * epsGraphics.setStroke( new BasicStroke( 1.5f ) );
 *
 * // Draw a single line.
 * epsGraphics.drawLine( 5, 5, 15, 5 );
 *
 * // Get the full EPS Document (header, content, footer, etc.).
 * String epsContent = epsDocument.getEpsDocument( title,
 *                                                 creator
 *                                                 pageWidth,
 *                                                 pageHeight,
 *                                                 minX,
 *                                                 minY,
 *                                                 maxX,
 *                                                 maxY );

    /**
     * Fully qualified constructor.
     * <p>
     * This is the only provided constructor; it is preferable for clients to
     * introduce their own defaulting if they don't like what is provided in the
     * associated ConverterToolkit Library for incomplete constructor parameter
     * list specification, rather than provide a variety of partially qualified
     * constructors here.
     * <p>
     * The ConverterToolkit Library is highly recommended to help you quickly
     * make appropriate use of this library, either through direct invocation of
     * its utility methods or as coding examples for your own custom code. The
     * library aims to normalize the differences between several vector graphics
     * output formats, and is decoupled from this library due to having
     * additional resource dependencies that not every downstream client needs.
     * <p>
     * This constructor makes an empty {@link EpsDocument} instance that writes
     * directly to a {@link StringBuilder}. It is premature to write the actual
     * content at this point, as it may need to be constructed algorithmically
     * or otherwise incrementally, with interim page offsets between each layout
     * component or between incremental invocations.
     * <p>
     * Basic parameters for the DXC Header, such as Title, Creator, Bounding
     * Box,
     * Page Width, and Page Height, are deferred until {@link #getEpsDocument}
     * is
     * invoked, so that the client code has complete flexibility in when to
     * query
     * the user for input, as well as how it determines the final bounding box.
