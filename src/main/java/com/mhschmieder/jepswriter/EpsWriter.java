 * {@code EpsWriter} is an interface that establishes the basic contract for
 * writing lines to an EPS Document.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of providing this interface, is to allow client applications and
 * third-party libraries to provide alternate implementations of the basic
 * methodology of export for EPS, if they find the {@link StringBuilder} based
 * implementations in this library for EpsGraphics2D and/or EpsDocument to be
 * too restrictive for their purposes. This allows everyone to take advantage of
 * the proven EPS operator handling in this library, which is more adherent to
 * specifications than other EPS libraries currently available.
