     * The key for the Rendering Hint that controls whether strings are rendered
     * as regular text or as vector graphics.
     * <p>
     * Vectorizing the text results in larger output files, but allows for more
     * precise rendering to match the on-screen appearance, as well as better
     * handling of rotated text (such as for vertical axis labels in charts). It
     * also handles the rendering of Unicode characters outside the normal
     * US-ASCII 7-bit character set, without having to resort to embedded fonts.
     * <p>
     * The resulting output has text that is much sharper and scalable, and
     * eliminates downstream issues with unavailable fonts on different systems.
     * <p>
     * Affine Transforms can only affect the starting point of text using Basic
     * Text Rendering Mode - all text will be oriented horizontally regardless.
     * <p>
     * With Vectorized Text Mode enabled, it is not necessary for the EPS Viewer
     * to have the required fonts installed.
     * <p>
     * Turning off Vectorized Text Mode requires the EPS Viewer to have the
     * necessary fonts installed. If there is a lot of text, this significantly
     * reduces the file size of your EPS Documents.
     * <p>
     * As most modern design software is able to recognize vectorized text that
     * was rendered from common fonts, EPS Viewers can still provide selectable
     * and editable text if this mode is set to vector graphics (the default).
     * <p>
     * Current valid hint values are: {@link #VALUE_TEXT_RENDERING_MODE_TEXT}
     * and {@link #VALUE_TEXT_RENDERING_MODE_VECTOR}.
